What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a simple YAML file to configure your
applicationâ€™s services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to run and scale applications with multiple Docker containers.

docker compose installation:

curl https://get.docker.com | bash
docker --version
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.30.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64
mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 compose
chmod 777 compose
compose --version
docker compose up -d
